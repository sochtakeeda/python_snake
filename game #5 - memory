# Memory is a card game in which the player deals out a set of cards face down. 
# In Memory, a turn (or a move) consists of the player flipping over two cards. 
# If they match, the player leaves them face up. If they don't match, the player flips the cards back face down. 
# The goal of Memory is to end up with all of the cards flipped face up in the minimum number of turns.
